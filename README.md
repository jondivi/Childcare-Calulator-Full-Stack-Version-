# Introduction

This is the README file for my 100 Hours Project....
It was built to assist families that have difficulty like me with trying to remember how much time is spent at various locations (like the babysitter!) and how much money we have to pay.

Developed by Jon Divi (with the help and support of the 100Devs community),implementing  MVC Architecture and "authorization" so folx can sign up and have a private and personal experience.
